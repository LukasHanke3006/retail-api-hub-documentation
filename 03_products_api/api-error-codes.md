## Severity levels

 - All errors with a severity level of *error* lead to a rejection of the entire product/variant (depending on the level of the error). The product/variant will not be created/updated at all.
 - All errors with a severity level of *warning* lead to a rejection of the individual attribute: The product/variant will still be created/updated in general, however the individual attribute will not be set or - in case of an update - it will be reset.
 - All errors with a severity level of *info* will not affect the data submission and are for information purpose only (e.g. providing information about not yet submitted recommended information)
